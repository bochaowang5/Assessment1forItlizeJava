# Assessment1 For itlize java 12.03 batch


Hey Everyone!

I just want to preface this by saying it has been an absolute blast and honor being in this Batch with all of you.
Personally, I never knew I would ever be in a bootcamp or any program in which people who are working towards a professional
goal are all this welcoming and caring. Let us be the best JAVA batch in this jawn and we're going to crush this 
assessment together. Let's get it.

## READMEs
Please read the READMEs for each section. They are listed below. I know I'm kinda garbage with writing md files so they are 
not pretty but hopefully they do the trick.

The recommended order to do (or from what I believe to be the order that is least challenging to most difficult) is:
* [BasicStrings](https://github.com/YangsWorkShop/Assessment1forItlizeJava/blob/master/BasicStringsREADME.md)
* [ArrayLists](https://github.com/YangsWorkShop/Assessment1forItlizeJava/blob/master/ArrayListsREADME.md)
* [MapPractice](https://github.com/YangsWorkShop/Assessment1forItlizeJava/blob/master/MapPracticeREADME.md)
* [Dan's Dilemma](https://github.com/YangsWorkShop/Assessment1forItlizeJava/blob/master/DansDilemmaREADME.md)
